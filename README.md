Based on the University of Ontario Institute of Technology's Internal Engineering Competition 2015. 

The challenge was to create a program that will determine the optimal layout of security devices if given a building's layout. The quality of various security devices is based on a scoring mechanisim, financial expense, and coverage in a grid overlay. The optimal solution will provide a high score, extensive coverage on the grid while also maintaining a low cost. Users of the software should also be able to manually configure the layout of devices and have the security score update based on changes made. 

This project placed first.
